        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In medium bowl, whisk flour, salt, and baking soda together. Set
            aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using a mixer with paddle attachment fitted, cream butter and sugar
            together on medium speed for about 3 - 4 minutes, or until light
            (60% aeration)
          </li>
          <li>
            Mix flaxseed meal, water, and vanilla extract together. Add mixture
            to mixer and mix until combined. Scrape down.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add dry ingredients all at once and mix on low speed until 90%
            incorporated. Scrape down.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add dark chocolate and mix until fully combined. Do not mix more
            than you need to. Scoop dough into 12 (2 oz/80 gram) mounds the size
            of golf balls. Transfer to parchment lined baking sheet and
            refrigerate overnight
          </li>
          <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Seperate cookies on baking sheet so
            they have room to grow.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake cookies for 15- 20 minutes, rotating halfway through. Pull when
            edges are golden brown and middle appears slightly under-baked.
            Sprinkle with sea salt and let cool completely before eating.
          </li>

      Note:<br />
      If you do not have a stand mixer you can use a spatula or wooden spoon to
      mix dough.<br />
      The mixing time for creaming your butter and sugar may be a bit longer
      (5-6 minutes).
